This app was almost entirely rewritten and completed on the last day I had to return this partly because Google Books decided to stop working due to rate limits :) so it is entirely scuffed. But it is what it is.

On the front page you can search for Star Wars related books and then click on the image or the title of any book to get more information on it.

You can also click on the Author names on both the front and /book/[id] pages to get more information on said author.

Trying the app:

you can run the command:


```npm run dev ```


OR
```npm run build```

and then: 
```npm run start```

To try the production build!
